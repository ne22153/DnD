 The outskirts have small villages often populated with non-human races as they are unwelcome in Litnich. This isn't an official issue, but a larger population of dwarves have come to harm late at night. Despite this, there's a small ppopulation of dwarves and elves that call Litnich their home. In fact, one ([Mordrom Forge][mordrom-forge]) owns the main bank and is the only place where you can exchange Hezenian Crowns for the generally accepted Orens.

 There is an underground community of sorcerers and wizards which still operate in Litnich. One of which is [Rhennel Liquelar][rhennel-liquelar], who was the one who tried to take out the [King][king-heriot]. She's the only person to evade the King's wrath and so he holds a heavy grudge against her.
