### Key Locations

 - [Her Majesty's Inquisition][inquisition], the large prison at the south of the island, cut off from the rest

 - [Manfried][manfried], a port city 
 - [Mount Ofmein][mount-ofmein], a mountain where they say trolls call home
 - [Pilgana][pilgana], a large city powered off of the flow of the river
 - [Quernmarry][quernmarry], a mining town which is slowly shrinking the island
 - [Ruins of Thale][ruins-of-thale], the leftovers of what once was before the chasm appeared
 - [The Chasm][chasm], the home of demons and fungi
 - [Wrea][wrea], a small village. The last stop before the inquisition's land, and a go to for runaways and guards alike
