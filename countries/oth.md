Country:
## Oth

Oth is made up of an archipelago and a mainland. The islands are the main source of trade and monarchy, which the mainland used for mining and farming.

### Royalty

The monarch of Oth is decided via competition. On the falling of the previous monarch, those interested must compete to do the hardest task. 

The islands are generally independent but report to the monarch on disputes and international problems. 

### People

Oth is home to lots of druids, and most people are religious, viewing these druids as connections between them and the Gods.
