## Reria

A group of islands which are rules by one monarch decided by competition. The islands are generally independent by report to the monarch on disputes and international problems. Home to a lot of druids as a lot of forests are left for them and the spirits. People are generally religious (some more than others), not wanting to upset the Gods, and view druids as the connection between them.
