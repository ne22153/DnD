### Oscura Bazaar

In the back streets of Pilgana, there's a square which sits emoty save for the nights of a full moon; when it is occupied by the 'Oscura Bazaar', a collection of stalls offering a range of not-so-legal goods.

**Madame Mallista's Curtains and Carpets**, where you can purchase cursed furniture and strange creature pelts.

**Buy 'n Large**, an auction house exclusive to members. Many real and fake relics can be found here.

**Red Items**, which only sells red things. Cloaks, potions, flowers, birds etc.

There's also many 'service' stalls, where customers pay large fees to get a question answered or a problem solved.
