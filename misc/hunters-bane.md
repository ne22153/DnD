*"To those who'd steal your soul, one must break one's soul first" - Grandmaster Acheros the Gleaming*
## Hunter's Bane

There are many mystical and arcane rituals known to this world, many manipulate strands from the Weave or are bestowed by the gods themselves to aid their followers in their hour of need. Few are exchanged across the realms and time, the machinations of beings not of this plane; ancient Fae creatures and long forgotten gods.

But there is power within each being, be they living, dead or somewhere in-between. Ancient secrets lingering through the veins, the mysteries of destruction and creation locked within a drop of blood, further diluting through the aeons with each generation, mixing, twisting and ever changing, spread across the four winds and beyond the barriers of the planes. Secrets outside the reach of all but a select few.

If something seems to good to be true, it's because it almost always is.

You can still taste it when you draw upon this ancient power as if you had only just ingested it, this "Hunter's Bane", as they called it. As the blood hunter handed you one vial after a other, you felt your body scream in agony as the viscous crimson's and purples rolled down your throat on consumption. The purple blood of a fiend in your throat, sulphurous and burning as your blade cut your own wrist, coating the edge in your own lifeblood, igniting it in searing flame. The chilling crimson of a frost giant, the brain freeze hitting you as you felt the saliva and mucus solidify from the cold, immediately coagulating in frost as you cut yourself across your thigh, small flecks of snow slowly drifting in the air as you moved the blade. The dry powder you had to work down your gullet, putrid decay as you forced yourself not to cough it up, blackened liquid oozing deep into your chest, crawling across the steel, expanding and contracting in step with your own heartbeat. A pale red vial, thrumming with electricity as you felt your muscles spasm at each crackle of lightning, sparks sputtering from the gash you made in your palms as if the fury of the Behir the blood once belonged to seemed to seep through, arcing and streaking to whatever it managed to spark across. An almost vaporous dark purple was contained in the vial labeled 'Djinn', the gaseous wrath rushing up through your nose when you tried to drink it, burrowing its way into your forehead as you felt your ears pound, the sense your brain was trying to break through your skull by force before drawing your blade deep through your earlobes, the trickle of blood scattering above the steel as it thrummed with a deep bass, rapidly building before exploding in a wave of noise. A thick, oozing red had nearly broken you, your body disabling your will to back out on the deal, the visages in your mind's eye of the terrifying banshee it had once belonged to giving rise to your deepest fears and insecurities before eventually overcoming them, drawing the blade across your forehead, a trickle of blood stretching out, playfully zigzagging around the metal surface in long thin lines, occasionally making out words and names in the blink of an eye.

The self inflicted wounds seemed to heal up rapidly the magic of the rite faded, time seemed to move at a hastened pace, healing over the cuts in seconds, the scars fading as if decades had passed within minutes.

Once there were no longer any vials in sight, you felt relieved, thankful for this ordeal to be over. Your breath laboured as you gasped for air on your knees, you looked up to see the blood hunter standing over you, blade in hand as they told you you had succeeded on your preparations for the ritual. Before you had a time to process their words, you felt sharp pains as the daggers slashed across your neck. Streams of crimson began to spout, your heartbeat struggling to keep working with the rapidly reducing volume of lifeblood in your body.

You felt your skin going cold as your eyes became heavy, the blood loss slowly letting you drift into unconsciousness as the body began shutting down in a state of self-preservation. Sounds grew distant, muffled as you heard the blood hunters voice one last time before darkness took you.

### Profane Soul Ritual

Those who are members of the Profane Soul Order push the limits of hemocraft in order to hunt greater threats of the arcane. This requires delving into the same well of corrupting knowledge, and making a pact with lesser evils.

### Mutant Ritual

The Mutant Order has dedicated it's time to refining the way which hemocraft alters the body. Because of this, their ritual involves multiple mutagens, all with different effects and with staggerring consequences.

### Ghostslayer Ritual

The Ghostslayer Order being the oldest of all, their ritual is the closest to 'base'. It requires the participant to reach death's door and pass through, yet still make it back to the land of the living.

### Lycan Ritual

The Lycan Order have their own name for the ritual *"the Taming"*, which involves the ceremonial infliction of lycanthropy by a senior member.
