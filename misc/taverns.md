## Taverns

### Piss Poor

A cheap tavern with rumours that they piss in the ale. Owned by a group of kobolds, but the 'face' is a Draconic speaking dwarf, as they want to seem more 'professional'.

### The Lucky Leaf

Each drink ordered has a 1 in 20 chance of having 1sp at the bottom of the cup. The tavern is themed around leprechauns and rainbows, but has ended up as a 'Mecca' for queer adventurers.

### The Rusty Gear

All drinks are delivered via seemingly random Rube Goldberg machines. There's no actual servers, the customers just say "Gear, I'd like a [drink]".

### Donkey's Ass

Pretty average tavern, except there's no seats, just rugs and short tables. Founded by a gnome who couldn't reach bar stools in other taverns.

### The Loud House

A tavern/music venue known for booking famous bards to perform. Drinks are overpriced, but themed around the current performer.
