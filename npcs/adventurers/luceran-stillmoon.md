This was turned down by [Darian's][darian-sunfire] deity, claiming that Luceran was not worthy to reach said planes.

# Psychology

| -------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| Personality                                              | While he generally likes to keep to himself, Luceran will fiercly protect those he cares about, often with little concern for his own health. He won't take a job unless he agrees with the opinions of the employer and the possible outcomes, which has lead to some issues in the past. When he doesn't like someone, he despises them, often taking up huge parts of his mind until either something more important happens or he gives said person some sort of retribution. |
| Habits                                                   | Every morning, mirror permitting, he checks his appearance in the mirror, often touching significant scars. This is also a nervous twitch, and running his fingers over the scars on his arms tends to keep him grounded. |
| Ambition                                                 | He wants to track down [Berilac Winterthorn][berilac-winterthorn] and make him realise what a mistake he made messing with him. |
| Greatest fear                                            | Spies. He's incredibly paranoid that he's always being watched, so will always be on edge when in public. |
| Biggest secret                                           | It was him who folded and let his patron influence [Arion Stormrider][arion-stormrider], which lead to him breaking his oath, and eventually Eclipsed Valor splitting up. |
| How does this character get along with other characters? | When in a group of people that he respects, then he surprisingly emerges as a leader. Because of this, most people he knows like him, despite the fact he doesn't tend to realise. |
