Quest:
## For the Crown!

### Setting
[Oth][oth]

### Description
The King of Oth has passed away in battle, and the selection of the new monarch has begun. There are 3 main contenders for the crown, all of which are from the Archipeligo:
 - A brother and sister from [Sein Oth][sein-oth]
 - A bear of a man from [Nar Oth][nar-oth]

In order to be selected as monarch, the individual must complete the most impressive feat of strength. One decides to take down a mountain giant, another wants to save a kidnapped child from a group of war deserters on [Ank Oth][ank-oth], and the last wants to remove a curse from an old mansion on [Nar Oth][nar-oth] which has been killing intruders for 20 years. 

All will ask the players to help them in their quest. Based on which they choose, they can influence who is crowned and how the future of [Oth][oth] develops
