Quest:
## Ghostly Whispers

### Setting
[Clastimon][clastimon]

### Description
A small village has been ravaged by a ghost for some time now. It originates from the group of houses just outside the village. One of the houses was home to a couple where the husband was rather abusive to his wife. In the end, she lashed out and killed him, dropping his body into the well. Surrounded in grief, she kills herself.

Her sister comes to visit not long after, and finds everything that has happened. She tries to 'fix' the situation, but is caught off guard when she sees a ghost which resembles her sister. Being surprised, she runs away, just escaping, and tries to tell all the villagers. The few that go to investigate don't come back, so the villagers are willing to pay a good amount for anyone who can rid them of it.
