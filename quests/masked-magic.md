## Masked Magic

### Setting
[Litnich][litnich]

### Description
[Lady Cithrel Voldavie][cithrel-voldavie] has found that her son Albert has been experimenting with magic, and not hiding it very well. Albert, who is a half-wit, knows about the laws of the land but thinks that his mother's money will keep him from any punishment. This is unfortunately not true. Lady Cithrel will invite the players to join her masked ball where she plans to smuggle Albert out of the country and to her brother in Othen. If the players have already completed the quest to do with [smuggling the mages out of Litnich][time-to-shine], then he will join them on the outskirts.
