## Money Trumps All

### Setting
[Litnich][litnich]

### Description
[Mordrom Forge][mordrom-forge] has had a series of mysterious death threats made through multiple letters. They are all signed by a pseudonym, ['Collective'][collective] and a crest that seems mildly familiar. He'll give anyone a vast reward to take care of this, with proof of finding the cause and eradicating it.
