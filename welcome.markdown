Welcome to Komoda, a continent full of civil unrest and unruly magic.

Political unrest has been brewing; life for those of the lower class is barely livable, with inflation high. Homelessness is rampant throughout the big cities, and little is done by the guards other than 'banning' them from certain areas.

## Countries

There's 4 main countries in Komoda:
 - [Theomarre][theomarre], the gem of the north
 - [Reria][reria], an island nation to the west
 - [Othen][othen], no man's land
 - [Hezena][hezena], the up-and-comers
